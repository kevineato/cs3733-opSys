1. I did not collaborate with anybody.

2. I believe both of my programs are correct as I tested them several times
using scan-build and valgrind.

3. My programs are working perfectly.

4. The only challenge was a newline character being stored in the stdin buffer that was
messing up my driver1 program, but I solved it by checking, before my while loop,
one time for the newline character. Assignment was a decent first assignment for
this course.
