2. I believe both of my programs are correct as I tested them several times
using scan-build and valgrind.

4. I would suggest making this a little more relevant to scheduling by using
structs to represent the processes instead of strings, because with structs you
can implement the rules for the fcfs algorithm closer to how it really is, while
with strings we are simply implementing rules based on letters instead of whether
a process is running or waiting.
